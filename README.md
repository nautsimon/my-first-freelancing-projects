[[Class of 2023 clock](https://unruffled-mcclintock-886ffb.netlify.app)]

[[RD Recicla](https://rdrecicla.com)]
<br />This was the first website I was paid to make. I was hired to create RD Recicla to help people recycle in the Dominican Republic. There is a language toggle and custom google map. The google map api is no longer connected to a credit card so there is an overlay on the map.

**2017**
--------------------
[[STEM-Dominica V1](http://simonmahns.github.io)]
