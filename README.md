# My-First-14-Web-Projects

**2019**
--------------------
*RD Recicla: rdrecicla.com*
I was hired to create RD Recicla to help people recycle in the dominican republic. There is a language toggle and custom google map. The google map api is no longer connected to a credit card so there is an overlay on the map.

*Root Cellar Makerspace placeholder website: https://lucid-kare-8f5870.netlify.app*
I created this placeholder for a makerspace founding group I was part of when I was in high school. Cool three.js animation.

*BuildaBot Ghana: https://nifty-stallman-945b6b.netlify.app*
A quick website I made for a project I ran in Ghana with my old nonprofit.

*STEM-Dominica: https://sharp-hamilton-e9f332.netlify.app*
A quick website I made for a couple projects in the Dominican Republic with my old nonprofit.

--------------------
*Chrome store productivity app: pesto-aioli*
This was my first project in reactjs. A productivity chrome app that can record things to do and have hot links appear on each new page. I still use this today.

*The CC: https://zen-bartik-72f3de.netlify.app*
I created this website for my friend who was starting a SAT/ACT help newsletter. It is connected to an Spring Boot API served by AWS that I created.

*Omnified’s website: https://relaxed-lewin-868bff.netlify.app*
My LLC’s old website. 

*ORION’s website: https://vigorous-almeida-6f9b9c.netlify.app*

**2017**
--------------------
*STEMDR First Iteration: http://simonmahns.github.io* nMy very first website. Made with vanilla HTML and CSS. Also a reminder of my youth, as I created this by staying up all night without any caffine. The good old days.
