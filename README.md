--------------------
[[Class of 2023 clock](https://unruffled-mcclintock-886ffb.netlify.app)]
<br />My friend and I after our first quarter at school had gone by too fast. We wanted a way to keep track of our time, this was our solution (time calculations may be inaccurate because of covid).
<br />Tools/Languages: Javascript (ReactJs, ThreeJs) and Photoshop.

[[RD Recicla](https://rdrecicla.com)]
<br />This was the first website I was paid to make. I was hired to create RD Recicla to help people recycle in the Dominican Republic. There is a language toggle and custom google map. The google map api is no longer connected to a credit card so there is an overlay on the map.
<br />Tools/Languages: Javascript (ReactJs), Google Maps API, Netlify, Photoshop, and Cloudinary. 

[[Root Cellar Makerspace placeholder website](https://lucid-kare-8f5870.netlify.app)]
<br />I created this placeholder for a makerspace founding group I was part of when I was in high school. Cool three.js animation.

<br />A quick website I made for a project I ran in Ghana with my old nonprofit.

--------------------
[[Chrome productivity app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesto-aioli/baalpccnhigkkjhdaacgbkfopdcpbemp)]
<br />This was my first project in reactjs. A productivity chrome app that can record things to do and have hot links appear on each new page. I still use this today.
<br />Tools/Languages: Javascript (ReactJs), Chrome Developer Tools, Netlify and Photoshop.

[[The CC V1 and V2](https://zen-bartik-72f3de.netlify.app)]

**2017**
--------------------
[[STEM-Dominica V1](http://simonmahns.github.io)] 
<br />My very first website. Made with vanilla HTML and CSS. Also a reminder of my youth, as I created this in one all nighter without any caffeine. The good old days, now I can't live without at least 7 hours.
